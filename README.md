# Oracle iOS Code Challenge

This repository contains my solution to Oracle's iOS Code Challenge for the year 2023.

## Overview

This iOS application retrieves and displays the latest prices of cryptocurrencies using the CoinGecko API. 
Users can explore cryptocurrency details, search for specific cryptocurrencies, and refresh the data. 
In addition to meeting the core requirements, I have also added extra features like animations and unit tests for enhanced functionality and quality.

## Features

- **Main Screen**
  - Displays the first 20 cryptocurrencies with details such as name, symbol, current price, last updated date, and an image.
  - Provides a refresh button to update the information.

- **Detail Screen**
  - Shows detailed information about a selected cryptocurrency, including its name, image, total volume, highest price, lowest price, price change, and market cap.

- **Search Functionality**
  - Includes a search bar to filter cryptocurrencies by name.

- **Additional Features**
  - Added animations to enhance the user interface.
  - Implemented unit tests to ensure code reliability.
  - Employed UI tests to verify the application's user interface.
